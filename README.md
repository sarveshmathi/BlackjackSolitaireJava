Blackjack Solitaire game implementation in Java (non-GUI)

Implementation of the Blackjack Solitaire game found here:

http://www.solitairenetwork.com/solitaire/blackjack-square-solitaire-game.html

The game is a solo game, so in that sense it is like Solitaire, 
but all of the scoring comes from Blackjack. In Blackjack, a handâ€™s score should stay at or below a value of 21.
In this game, Blackjack hands are scored from nine hands formed by each of the four rows and five columns
of the grid of cards laid out. To play the game, you draw cards one at a time from the deck and place them on the grid. 
Once placed, a card cannot be moved. The four discard spots allow one to ignore four cards by 
placing them in the discard spots rather than on the grid. Once all 16 spots in the grid have cards, a score is calculated.
